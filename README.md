## Home:
This is the place where I have a brief introduction about myself and plan to add more interactive features in the future.

## About:
A more detailed introduction of myself from the aspects of school, life, habits, etc. Planning to add more pics of mine and a description of my technique skills in the future.

## Project:
This will be the place where I list all projects I have done and categorize them into different skill sets to showcase my ability to tackle different kinds of problems.

## Resume:
This section will contain an up-to-date resume of mine and in the future, a CV will be included as well.

There are a whole lot of more fantastic features I am going to add to this website, such as blogs, rewards, journals, etc!!! Be prepared to see more stuff in the future.
